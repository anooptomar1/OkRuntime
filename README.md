## Inspiration
Smart Maps that exist today has a certain level of intelligence. We want to take it to the next level

## What it does

Our beautiful and intelligent map helps you in getting curated lists in a way you have never experienced before. Our map is capable of providing data like list of houses for sale around a school you wish your kids could attend. It can do many more things as long as you have related data

## How we built it
We build this application using Quartz Runtime SDK for iOS, Apple speech kit, text to speech technologies. We used features like `setviewpoint`, `featurelayer definition expression`, `feature layer query`, `popups`.

## Challenges we ran into
Since this is the first time anyone of us working on technologies like speechkit and text to speech, implementing these core technologies are challenging.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We were able to bring together multiple capabilities of the Runtime SDK and create an intelligent map that we initially targeted. 

## What we learned
Since all of us are from different teams and different technical backgrounds, coming together and working together on a single project exposed us to different enivironment and taught us what more we can do other than just coding

## What's next for Ok! Map
Predictive capabalities like answering to the query `How much this house is going to cost in 6 months?` using the existing metrics.  
Delegating work of the map to an assistant map, for example, while the map is navigating, spawn another request for direction between two new places, the map should be able to delegate that work to its assistant map
